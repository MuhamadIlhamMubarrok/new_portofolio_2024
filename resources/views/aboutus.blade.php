                    Hello, my name is Muhamad Ilham Mubarrok. I am a full-stack developer specializing in back-end
                    development. My educational background began at a pesantren, which led me to continue my studies at IDN
                    Polytechnic, where I am scheduled to graduate in 2026. During my studies, I have not only focused on
                    academics but also actively participated in organizations. My involvement in these organizations has
                    enriched my knowledge of technology and expanded my professional network.

                </p>
                <p>I am very enthusiastic about continuous learning, and one way I do this is by pursuing relevant
                    certifications from various sources, including those offered by the government or other institutions.
                    This allows me to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the world of technology.
                </p>

                    Additionally, I am in the process of building a software house with my campus friends called "Citra
                    Indah Group." This project started from a close friendship while living together, and it has now grown
                    into a business that we dream of together.

                </p>
                <p>I have three years of work experience, which includes teaching at a school, freelancing, and working in a
                    tech company. This experience has provided me with various perspectives and valuable skills for my
                    career as a programmer.
                </p>
                <p>Outside of work, I have various hobbies such as GYM, billiards, basketball, and volleyball. These
                    activities help me maintain a balance between work and personal life, as well as give me the energy and
                    enthusiasm to keep creating.
